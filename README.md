## About

This is a summary of coding done for the #IndyHack 2016, see competition details here

I worked on the auditor of state challenge to create a dashboard to provide more visibility and
transparency to state spending.

Here is my hosted application from the hackathon : https://gichoya.shinyapps.io/HackApp/

## Summary

I used R and shiny to create an interactive dashboard that allows one to filter and dial into data . For example ,
if you were curious if a specific vendor was paid on a certain date you can filter on Merchant and Date of Transaction

## Next Steps

1. Subset data to show what i thought were relevant fields
2. Add a more or complete fields data
3. Upload and download buttons
4. Social media sharing link
5. Personal feedback: Review examples in the shiny examples to see whats possible regarding data presentation
